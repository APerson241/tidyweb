The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work together. This site is a work-in-progress guide to the tidyverse and its packages.

If you are new to the tidyverse, the best place to learn the complete philsophy and how everything fits together is the [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book. This book is available for free online, and can you order a physical copy from [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1) (currently taking pre-orders, the book should be out by the end of the year).

## Installation

Install the complete tidyverse with a single line of code:

```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
